```

Gene Prevalence Across Samples: We can calculate the frequency of each defense gene across the samples to see which genes are most prevalent:

Heatmap of Defense Genes by Column (COL) and Row (ROW)

```{r}
# Prepare the data for the heatmap by aggregating counts of defense genes by COL and ROW
heatmap_data <- as.data.frame(table(defense_genes$COL, defense_genes$ROW))
colnames(heatmap_data) <- c("COL", "ROW", "Frequency")

# Convert COL and ROW to factors for better axis labeling
heatmap_data$COL <- as.factor(heatmap_data$COL)
heatmap_data$ROW <- as.factor(heatmap_data$ROW)

# Plot the heatmap with improved axis text visibility
ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = COL, y = ROW, fill = Frequency)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 8),  # Increase x-axis text size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)  # Increase y-axis text size
  ) +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Defense Genes by Column and Row", 
       x = "Column", y = "Row") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(heatmap_data$COL)[seq(1, length(levels(heatmap_data$COL)), by = 5)]) +  # Show every 5th label
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = levels(heatmap_data$ROW)[seq(1, length(levels(heatmap_data$ROW)), by = 5)])    # Show every 5th label

```

Heatmap of Defense Genes by Column (COL) and GO_ID

goid_heatmap_data <- as.data.frame(table(defense_genes$COL, defense_genes$GO_ID))
colnames(goid_heatmap_data) <- c("COL", "GO_ID", "Frequency")

# Convert COL and GO_ID to factors for better axis labeling
goid_heatmap_data$COL <- as.factor(goid_heatmap_data$COL)
goid_heatmap_data$GO_ID <- as.factor(goid_heatmap_data$GO_ID)

# Plot the heatmap for GO_ID with improved axis text visibility
ggplot(goid_heatmap_data, aes(x = COL, y = GO_ID, fill = Frequency)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "green") +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Defense Genes by Column and GO_ID", x = "Column", y = "GO_ID") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 8),  # Increase x-axis text size
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)  # Increase y-axis text size
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(goid_heatmap_data$COL)[seq(1, length(levels(goid_heatmap_data$COL)), by = 5)]) +  # Show every 5th label on x-axis
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = levels(goid_heatmap_data$GO_ID)[seq(1, length(levels(goid_heatmap_data$GO_ID)), by = 5)])  # Show every 5th label on y-axis




```

Top 10 Most Frequent Sequences

```{r}
# Investigating the sequence data
unique_sequences <- unique(defense_genes$SEQUENCE)
sequence_counts <- table(defense_genes$SEQUENCE)

# Plot the top 10 most frequent sequences
top_sequences <- as.data.frame(sequence_counts[order(-sequence_counts)][1:10])
colnames(top_sequences) <- c("SEQUENCE", "Frequency")

ggplot(top_sequences, aes(x = reorder(SEQUENCE, -Frequency), y = Frequency)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Frequent Sequences", x = "Sequence", y = "Frequency")

```

Top Defense Genes by Frequency in the Dataset

```{r}
# Create a bar plot of the most frequent defense genes by 'DESCRIPTION'
gene_frequency <- as.data.frame(table(defense_genes$DESCRIPTION))
colnames(gene_frequency) <- c("Gene", "Frequency")

# Filter to show the top 10 most frequent defense genes
top_genes <- gene_frequency[order(-gene_frequency$Frequency), ][1:10, ]

# Plot the bar chart
ggplot(top_genes, aes(x = reorder(Gene, -Frequency), y = Frequency)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Frequent Defense Genes in the Dataset", 
       x = "Gene", y = "Frequency")

```

Distribution of Defense Genes by GO_ID

```{r}
# Prepare data for the pie chart by summarizing the distribution by GO_ID
go_distribution <- as.data.frame(table(defense_genes$GO_ID))
colnames(go_distribution) <- c("GO_ID", "Count")

# Filter to exclude empty or missing GO_IDs
go_distribution_filtered <- go_distribution[go_distribution$GO_ID != "-", ]

# Plot a pie chart showing the distribution of defense genes by GO_ID
ggplot(go_distribution_filtered, aes(x = "", y = Count, fill = GO_ID)) +

  coord_polar("y") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Defense Genes by GO_ID") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

```

Sequence Length Distribution of Defense Genes

```{r}
# Compute the length of each gene sequence
defense_genes$Sequence_Length <- nchar(defense_genes$SEQUENCE)

# Plot a histogram of the sequence lengths
ggplot(defense_genes, aes(x = Sequence_Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, fill = "purple", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Defense Gene Sequence Lengths", 
       x = "Sequence Length", y = "Frequency")

```

Exploring Gene-Stress Relationships In order to explore the relationship between defense genes and stress responses, we will first check if the dataset contains any relevant columns or markers that might indicate stress conditions (e.g., stress-related genes or pathways). If not, we may simulate or use hypothetical stress data for the sake of the analysis.

```{r}
# Check for columns related to stress response (assuming we have stress markers in the dataset)
stress_related_genes <- defense_genes[grepl("stress|response", defense_genes$DESCRIPTION, ignore.case = TRUE), ]

# Display the first few rows to see if stress-related genes are present
head(stress_related_genes)

# If stress-related genes exist, we can perform additional analysis or visualization
if (nrow(stress_related_genes) > 0) {
  barplot(table(stress_related_genes$NAME),
          main = "Bar Plot of Stress-Related Defense Genes",
          xlab = "Gene Name",
          ylab = "Frequency",
          col = "steelblue")
} else {
  message("No stress-related defense genes found.")
}

```

Phylogenetic Tree of Defense Genes To build phylogenetic trees showing the evolutionary relationship of defense genes, I will focus on using the sequences available in the dataset (if provided). We'll need to align these sequences and use them to generate the tree.

```{r}
# Define the number of sequences to subset
subset_size <- 50
seq_list_subset <- seq_list[1:subset_size]

# Initialize the distance matrix for the subset
dist_matrix_subset <- matrix(NA, subset_size, subset_size)

# Compute the distance matrix, handling any NA/NaN/Inf values
for (i in 1:subset_size) {
  for (j in i:subset_size) {
    distance <- compute_distance(seq_list_subset[[i]], seq_list_subset[[j]])
    
    # Check for valid numeric values, otherwise set to 0
    if (!is.na(distance) && !is.nan(distance) && !is.infinite(distance)) {
      dist_matrix_subset[i, j] <- distance
      dist_matrix_subset[j, i] <- distance
    } else {
      dist_matrix_subset[i, j] <- 0
      dist_matrix_subset[j, i] <- 0
      warning(paste("Invalid distance between sequence", i, "and sequence", j))
    }
  }
}

# Convert the cleaned distance matrix to 'dist' object
dist_matrix_subset <- as.dist(dist_matrix_subset)

# Perform hierarchical clustering on the subset
phylo_tree_subset <- hclust(dist_matrix_subset)

# Set plot parameters for better readability
par(cex = 0.8, las = 2, mar = c(5, 4, 4, 10), xpd = NA)

# Plot the dendrogram for the subset
plot(phylo_tree_subset, main = "Phylogenetic Tree of Defense Genes (Subset)", 
     sub = "Based on sequence similarity (First 50 Sequences)", 
     xlab = "", 
     ylab = "Distance", 
     hang = -1, 
     col = "blue")

# Reset plot parameters to default
par(cex = 1, las = 0, mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2), xpd = FALSE)

PADLOC Analysis

```{r}
# Simulate the Padloc output data
padloc_output <- data.frame(
  Genome = c("Acinetobacter_1", "Acinetobacter_2", "Acinetobacter_3", "Acinetobacter_4", "Acinetobacter_5"),
  System_Type = c("CRISPR-Cas", "R-M", "TA", "R-M", "CRISPR-Cas"),
  Gene = c("cas1", "hpaII", "relE", "mcrA", "cas2"),
  Start_Position = c(5000, 12000, 4000, 15000, 7000),
  End_Position = c(6000, 13000, 4500, 16000, 7500),
  Strand = c("+", "-", "+", "-", "+"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Write the simulated data to a CSV file
write.csv(padloc_output, "/home/issah/Datasets/simulated_padloc_output.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Now read the CSV back into R as though it was the actual Padloc output
padloc_output <- read.csv("/home/issah/Datasets/simulated_padloc_output.csv", header = TRUE)

# Check the structure of the loaded data
str(padloc_output)

# Display the first few rows to ensure it's loaded correctly
head(padloc_output)

# Subset the data to focus on relevant defense systems (e.g., CRISPR-Cas, R-M, TA systems)
defense_systems <- padloc_output[grepl("CRISPR|R-M|TA", padloc_output$System_Type, ignore.case = TRUE), ]

# View the filtered defense systems
head(defense_systems)

# Summary of defense gene systems
summary(defense_systems$System_Type)

# Plot a bar chart of defense gene system occurrences
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(defense_systems, aes(x = System_Type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Defense Gene Systems", x = "System Type", y = "Count")

```

Gene Distribution Across Genomes You can analyze how defense systems like CRISPR-Cas, Restriction-Modification (R-M), and Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) are distributed across different bacterial genomes.

```{r}
# Count occurrences of each defense system in different genomes
library(dplyr)
defense_distribution <- padloc_output %>%
  group_by(Genome, System_Type) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

# Visualize defense system distribution across genomes
ggplot(defense_distribution, aes(x = Genome, y = Count, fill = System_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Defense Systems Across Genomes",
       x = "Genome",
       y = "Defense System Count",
       fill = "System Type") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```

Defense System Coverage You can calculate and visualize the coverage of each defense system (length of defense genes) across the genome.

```{r}
# Compute gene length and plot defense system coverage
padloc_output$Gene_Length <- padloc_output$End_Position - padloc_output$Start_Position

ggplot(padloc_output, aes(x = System_Type, y = Gene_Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Gene Length Distribution by Defense System",
       x = "Defense System",
       y = "Gene Length (bp)")

```

Genome Heatmap of Defense Systems You can create a heatmap to visualize the presence or absence of each defense system across multiple genomes.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a binary matrix of genomes vs. defense systems using pivot_wider
heatmap_data <- padloc_output %>%
  group_by(Genome, System_Type) %>%
  summarise(Present = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = System_Type, values_from = Present, values_fill = 0)

# Convert to matrix format for heatmap plotting
heatmap_matrix <- as.matrix(heatmap_data[, -1])
rownames(heatmap_matrix) <- heatmap_data$Genome

# Plot heatmap
heatmap(heatmap_matrix, Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, col = heat.colors(256), scale = "none",
        margins = c(5, 10), xlab = "Defense System", ylab = "Genome")

```

Statistical Analysis of Defense Systems You can use statistical methods to determine whether there is any significant correlation between different defense systems in terms of their presence in various genomes.

```{r}
# Perform Chi-squared test to explore correlation between defense systems
defense_system_table <- table(padloc_output$Genome, padloc_output$System_Type)
chi_test_result <- chisq.test(defense_system_table)
print(chi_test_result)

```

Genomic Location Visualization You can create a plot showing the genomic location of each defense gene within each genome, helping to understand the arrangement of defense systems.

```{r}
# Plot genomic location of defense systems
ggplot(padloc_output, aes(x = Start_Position, xend = End_Position, y = Genome)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = Genome, color = System_Type), size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Genomic Location of Defense Systems",
       x = "Genomic Position",
       y = "Genome",
       color = "System Type")

```

Explore Co-occurrence of Defense Systems You can analyze how often different defense systems co-occur within the same genome.

```{r}
# Count co-occurrences of defense systems within genomes
co_occurrence <- padloc_output %>%
  group_by(Genome) %>%
  summarise(Systems_Present = paste(unique(System_Type), collapse = ", "))

# View co-occurrence data
print(co_occurrence)

```

Gene Frequency Distribution: Objective: Determine how frequently each type of defense gene (e.g., CRISPR, R-M, TA systems) appears across all genomes. Method: Count the occurrence of each system type (e.g., CRISPR-Cas, R-M, TA) and plot their frequencies using a bar graph.

```{r}
# Count the frequency of each defense gene system
system_count <- table(padloc_output$System_Type)

# Plot the frequency of defense systems
barplot(system_count, main = "Frequency of Defense Systems in Acinetobacter spp.",
        xlab = "Defense System", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue", las = 2)

```

Gene Presence Across Strains: Objective: Analyze how many strains contain each defense gene, which can highlight particularly widespread or rare defense systems. Method: Summarize the presence of defense genes across strains and visualize the percentage of genomes that contain each system.

```{r}
# Calculate the proportion of strains that have each system
system_presence <- colSums(heatmap_matrix) / nrow(heatmap_matrix)

# Plot the presence of each system across strains
barplot(system_presence * 100, main = "Presence of Defense Systems Across Strains",
        xlab = "Defense System", ylab = "Percentage of Strains", col = "lightgreen", las = 2)

```

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of Defense Gene Profiles: Objective: Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the defense gene data and see if there are natural groupings of strains based on their defense gene profiles. Method: Perform PCA and plot the first two principal components.

```{r}
# Perform PCA on defense gene profiles
pca_result <- prcomp(heatmap_matrix, scale. = TRUE)

# Plot the first two principal components
plot(pca_result$x[, 1], pca_result$x[, 2], col = "blue", pch = 19,
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "PCA of Defense Gene Profiles")

```

Cluster Analysis of Defense Gene Systems: Objective: Group genomes into clusters based on their defense gene profiles to see if there are distinct groups of strains. Method: Perform hierarchical clustering and visualize the clusters.

```{r}
# Perform hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(dist(heatmap_matrix))

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(hc, main = "Hierarchical Clustering of Defense Gene Profiles", xlab = "", ylab = "Distance")

```

### **Bar Plot of Most Frequent Genes (GENE_SYMBOL)**

This can help you identify which defense genes appear most frequently in your dataset.

```         
```

```{r}
# Bar plot of the most frequent genes
ggplot(defense_genes, aes(x = GENE_SYMBOL)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Most Frequent Defense Genes", x = "Gene Symbol", y = "Frequency")


```
